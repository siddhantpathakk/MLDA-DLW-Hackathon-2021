## Problem Statement:
We believe that AI has endless possibilities, and it should not be limited to a certain theme. Therefore, the task is to build an AI-based solution that we are passionate about. The solution should be meaningful, have a positive impact on society or assist industries in their respective domain (software and hardware). 

## Our Solution: 
We aim to analyze the historical data, i.e., the open, high, low, and close prices of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, along with real-time sentimental analysis of the tweets centered around the same for a similar time to predict the weighted price of the token by the end of the trading market.

## Footnotes:
We are assuming the cryptocurrency market is affected by only these 5-6 variables, which is however untrue because the market is extremely volatile. special events such as Election Results Day, UN global sessions, Independence Day, and various other occasions where the market doesnâ€™t behave rationally.

Due to time constraints, a lot of intertwined fields were not explored. This project currently only considers Twitter data for sentimental analysis. However, with the GameStop (GME) stock market anomaly, we can assume Reddit is also a reliable source of information regarding the same. Thus, one area of further exploration is involving the Reddit API (PRAW) to also consider famous cryptocurrency-specific subreddit threads and discussion forums.

Also, this project currently focuses solely on Bitcoin, due to its centrality in the cryptocurrency market. However, we can investigate other tokens as well such as Ethereum, etc.

Alternatively, for easier user convenience we can inculcate this backend process onto a hosted website, or social media platform bots such as Telegram bots, Discord bots, WhatsApp bots, etc.

Due to GitHub's size constraints, the dataset containing the historical market values of Bitcoin could not be uploaded as a CSV file. Therefore, we provide a link (from Kaggle) which is also referenced to in the report:

The other relevant datasets have been uploaded in the repository.
